    Integer(val)
  end

  attr, and offer xml_reader and xml_accessor as well.  Remove the :readonly arg in the process

  call #to_s first every time [Ben Woosley]

* Allow a ROXML object to call its constructor on initialization with the xml_construct function
  [Ben Woosley]

* Use symbols (e.g. :text_content) rather than TAG_CONSTANTS (e.g. TEXT_CONTENT) for readability

  position-independence, and invisible exclusion [Ben Woosley]
