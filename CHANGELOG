== 2.3 (?)

* Rationalize sub-element xml naming by enforcing the following precedence for the containing xml of an object:
  :from of parent, xml_name of child, parent's accessor name.  The previous fallback did not include xml_name.
  This new behavior is more consistent, explicit, predictable, and DRY, but it is a breaking change, so a warning
  is printed to alert others of this behavior change. ROXML::SILENCE_XML_NAME_WARNING may be used to deactivate this
  warning. [Ben Woosley, jwthompson2, Delynn Berry]

* Deprecate Array#to_h in favor of Array#to_hash [Ben Woosley]

* Deprecate Object#to_latin and Object#to_utf in favor of the same methods on String [Ben Woosley]

== 2.1 (October 3, 2008)

* rake test now uses the default parser selection [Ben Woosley]

* Added rcov code coverage for tests [Anders Engström]

* Accommodate that libxml requires you to name the default namespace when available [Ben Woosley]

* Enable optional selection of a parser through the early definition of ROXML::XML_PARSER
  [Ben Woosley]

* Enable fallback to the REXML parser if LibXML is unavailable [Ben Woosley]

== 2.0 (September 20, 2008)

* :text_content becomes simply :content, and is joined by :name  [Ben Woosley]

* Allow hash mapping from node names and contents: [Ben Woosley]

  xml_reader :name, {:key => :name,
                     :value => :content}, :in => 'container'

* Allow supplying a default via the :else option [Ben Woosley]

* Allow hash mapping of text and attr elements: [Ben Woosley]

  xml_reader :name, {:key => {:text => 'key_name'},
                     :value => {:attr => 'attr_name'}}, :in => 'container'

* Allow 'xml_reader :name, [Type]' as an alternative to 'xml_reader :name, Type, :as => :array'
  [Ben Woosley]

* Allow attaching a block for manipulating a value on fetch: [Ben Woosley]

  xml_accessor :count, :attr => 'my_int' do |val|
    Integer(val)
  end

* Collapse xml_attr, xml_text and xml_object into a single api: xml, patterned after the standard
  attr, and offer xml_reader and xml_accessor as well.  Remove the :readonly arg in the process
  [Ben Woosley]

* Attach string extensions (#to_latin, #to_utf) to Object rather than String, so we don't have to
  call #to_s first every time [Ben Woosley]

* Allow a ROXML object to call its constructor on initialization with the xml_construct function
  [Ben Woosley]

* Use symbols (e.g. :text_content) rather than TAG_CONSTANTS (e.g. TEXT_CONTENT) for readability
  [Ben Woosley]

* Use named arguments (e.g. :as, :in) rather than positional for clarity,
  position-independence, and invisible exclusion [Ben Woosley]

* Split out rails_plugin_package_task_gem [Ben Woosley]

* Increase testing significantly, particularly on new functionality & to_xml [Ben Woosley]

== 1.2 (October 10, 2007)

* Fix a bug such that the TEXT_CONTENT tag is no longer also READ_ONLY [Russ Olsen]

== 1.1 (September 24, 2006)

* Initial design & development [Zak Mandhro & Anders Engstrom]
